**AWS Cognito PoC with Static HTML App**

This repository
showcases a Proof of Concept (PoC) integrating **AWS
Cognito** for user authentication with a simple static HTML application.
The app uses Cognitoâ€™s Hosted UI for login and logout functionality and
connects authenticated users to an S3 bucket via Cognito Identity Pools. The
entire setup is managed with **Terraform**,
making it repeatable and easy to deploy.

**ðŸŽ‰ What I Learned and Achieved**

Through this PoC,
Iâ€™ve gained valuable insights and successfully implemented a range of features
and configurations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of my learnings and accomplishments:

**1. Terraform for AWS Cognito Setup**

- Provisioned a **Cognito User Pool** to handle user management.
- Configured a **User Pool Client** to link the app with the User Pool.
- Set up a **User Pool Domain** to enable Cognitoâ€™s Hosted UI for authentication.
- Managed all AWS resources with Terraform, ensuring a fully reproducible infrastructure.

**2. Static HTML App with Cognito Integration**

- Developed a lightweight static app with three core pages:
    - index.html: Entry page with login/register options.
    - logged_in.html: Post-login page displaying an S3 file list.
    - logged_out.html: Confirmation page after logout.
- Integrated Cognito by redirecting users to the Hosted UI and handling authentication callbacks.

**3. User Management and Security**

- Disabled public signups to restrict access, allowing only admin-created users.
- Mastered **CSV user imports** for efficient bulk user management.
- Configured the User Pool to use **email as usernames** with auto-verified email settings.

**4. S3 Integration with Cognito Identity Pools**

- Established a **Cognito Identity Pool** to provide temporary AWS credentials to authenticated users.
- Created an **IAM role** granting read access to a designated S3 bucket.
- Added JavaScript to logged_in.html to securely list S3 bucket contents post-login.

**5. Customization of Cognito Hosted UI**

- Personalized the Hosted UI with:
    - A **custom logo** for branding.
    - **CSS styling** to tweak backgrounds, buttons, and overall appearance.
- Managed UI customizations via Terraform for consistency across deployments.

**6. Troubleshooting and Debugging**

- Overcame challenges like:
    - OAuth misconfigurations in the User Pool Client.
    - Token handling issues in the static app.
    - Region mismatches and IAM permission errors.
    - CORS setup for seamless S3 access from the browser.

**ðŸš€ Key Features Implemented**

- **User Authentication**: Seamless login/logout via Cognito Hosted UI with proper redirects.
- **Secure S3 Access**: Authenticated users can view files in a private S3 bucket using temporary credentials.
- **Customized UI**: Styled login page with a custom logo and CSS for a polished user experience.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform drives the deployment of all AWS resources for simplicity and scalability.

**ðŸ“š Learnings Summary**

- **AWS Cognito Fundamentals**: Grasped the interplay of User Pools, Clients, and Domains for authentication.
- **Terraform Proficiency**: Leveraged Terraform to provision and manage cloud resources effectively.
- **Static App Challenges**: Adapted a static HTML app to handle dynamic authentication and AWS SDK interactions.
- **Security Practices**: Applied secure access controls using Identity Pools and IAM roles.
- **UI Customization**: Learned to enhance the Hosted UI to align with the appâ€™s branding.

This PoC lays a
strong groundwork for future AWS Cognito projects, proving out both
authentication and authorization in a straightforward, successful
implementation. Great job on getting this up and running!
